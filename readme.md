# py_grouparticles

Python code along with a `.plist` file to automatically generate a list of arxiv articles belonging to many authors.

NOTE: scheduled execution, then pushing to github repo only works for mac via `launchd`.

## Usage

- First, fork this repo.
- Edit [`search_queries.json`](search_queries.json) with your own search queries to send to the arxiv API.
- Edit[`com.arxiv.daemon.plist`](com.arxiv.daemon.plist) with your `$PATH` variable and location of forked repo, along with desired interval (in seconds) for when to re-run the script.
- Edit [`update_arxiv_list.sh`](update_arxiv_list.sh) with location of your python 3 installation and `source activate $YOURPYVIRTUALENV`.
- Run `cp com.arxiv.daemon.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- Run `launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.arxiv.daemon.plist`
- Edit code in [`include_html_test.html`](include_html_test.html) to point to your repo URL. You now can run this code on your website to include the autogenerated list. Note: uses [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com). [Working Example](https://quantum.cs.ucl.ac.uk/recent-publications/).

## Requirements

- Python 3. Packages `feedparser`, `json`, `toolz`.
- mac OS, `launchd`.
